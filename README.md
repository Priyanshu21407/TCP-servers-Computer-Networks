# About Project
This project involves the development of synchronous and asynchronous TCP servers. 
It demonstrates the use of multiple forked processes and multiple threads, and implements non-blocking server programs using I/O multiplexing 
with the select and poll system calls, and the epoll API.
# Key Features
## Synchronous TCP Server 
Handles client requests in a synchronous manner.
## Asynchronous TCP Server
Handles client requests asynchronously using multiple threads and processes.
## Non-blocking I/O
Implements non-blocking I/O using select, poll, and epoll.
## I/O Multiplexing
Efficiently manages multiple simultaneous connections.
Forked Processes and Multithreading: Demonstrates concurrency and parallelism.
